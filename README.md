#   Farkle : Dice Game
##  SwiftUI

I became interested in the dice game (Farkle) while playing the ```KingdomCome: Deliverence```. So, I made it using ```SwiftUI```

The game interacts with two ```class Player``` instances and the ```class Dice``` instances that each player has.

Each dice is in an array, and perform initiation, align, calculation in ```DiceModel.swift```

Player can change max score and player name by navigating ```SettingView.swift```

It's the first game I've ever made using ```Swift```, ```SwiftUI```.

Later, I will try to make bot and multiplay with other people =D
